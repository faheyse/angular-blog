            Welcome to my blog. I'll be using this blog to post about anything I find interesting. It will also serve
            as a way to showcase the work I've done both as part of my engineering degree, and as part of my own 
            learning. For example, the 'Finance' section will take you through my journey through the world of finance.

        <p><i>Sand Hill Road, is an arterial road in western
            Silicon Valley, California, running through Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Woodside, notable for
             its concentration of venture capital companies. The road has become a metonym for that industry;
              nearly every top Silicon Valley company has been the beneficiary of early funding from firms on Sand Hill Road.
           Its significance as a symbol of private equity and venture capitalism in the United States is compared to that of Wall Street
            and the stock market, K Street in Washington, D.C. and political lobbying, Madison Avenue for the advertising industry,
             or Harley Street in London, UK for private specialist medicine and surgery.
